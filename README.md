Use the Google Place ID to construct the correct review URL.
Create a QR Code for the Review Link:

Use Python with the qrcode library to generate the QR code.
Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to achieve this:

Step 1: Get the Place ID
You need the Place ID of your business to create a direct link to the review page. You can find your Place ID by visiting the Google Place ID Finder.

Step 2: Construct the Review URL
Once you have the Place ID, use it to construct the URL in the following format:

perl
Copy code
https://search.google.com/local/writereview?placeid=YOUR_PLACE_ID
Step 3: Generate the QR Code
Here is the Python code to generate the QR code for the review link:

Install the qrcode library if you haven't already:
sh
Copy code
pip install qrcode[pil]
Use the following Python code to generate the QR code:
python
Copy code
import qrcode

# Replace with your actual Place ID
place_id = "YOUR_PLACE_ID"

# Construct the Google review URL
url = f"https://search.google.com/local/writereview?placeid={place_id}"

# Generate the QR code
qr = qrcode.QRCode(
    version=1,
    error_correction=qrcode.constants.ERROR_CORRECT_L,
    box_size=10,
    border=4,
)
qr.add_data(url)
qr.make(fit=True)

# Create an image of the QR code
img = qr.make_image(fill='black', back_color='white')

# Save the image to a file
img.save("google_review_qr.png")
Replace "YOUR_PLACE_ID" with the actual Place ID of your shop.

Example Code with a Placeholder
Here's the full script with a placeholder for the Place ID:

python
Copy code
import qrcode

# Example Place ID (replace this with your actual Place ID)
place_id = "ChIJN1t_tDeuEmsRUsoyG83frY4"

# Construct the Google review URL
url = f"https://search.google.com/local/writereview?placeid={place_id}"

# Generate the QR code
qr = qrcode.QRCode(
    version=1,
    error_correction=qrcode.constants.ERROR_CORRECT_L,
    box_size=10,
    border=4,
)
qr.add_data(url)
qr.make(fit=True)

# Create an image of the QR code
img = qr.make_image(fill='black', back_color='white')

# Save the image to a file
img.save("google_review_qr.png")
Display the QR Code
Print and display the QR code in your shop with instructions for customers to scan it and leave a review. This will ensure they are taken directly to the review submission form for your business on Google.
